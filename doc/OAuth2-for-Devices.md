As an alternative for headless devices, you can use [OAuth2 for Devices](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ForDevices). It allows users to go to a simple URL and enter a short verification code. To enable this authorization method you have to specify the `-device` command line option along with `-id` and `-secret` the first time you run `google-drive-ocamlfuse` to get the access tokens. The only drawback is that with this OAuth2 flow you cannot access all the files in you Drive, but are limited to file created by `google-drive-ocamlfuse`. The first time you mount your Drive, after getting the access token, `google-drive-ocamlfuse` will create a folder named `gdfuse`. The application will have access only to that folder and only to files you will create/copy in the mounted drive.
